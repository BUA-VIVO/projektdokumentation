# Ontologies
Ontologies, are, in the context of Informatics, defined as "formal representation of concepts, their attributes and relations between them within a specific domain"

In our case, the project needed to work with Ontologies, in aiming to build a platform for researching, collecting and presenting scientists and their research as well as their activities within and across the members of the Berlin University Alliance (BUA), using the Linked Open Data software VIVO

[VIVO](https://github.com/vivo-project/VIVO) and more specifically [VITRO](https://github.com/vivo-project/Vitro) is software based on- and using Ontologies, originally representing and describing the American Academic Domain. As the entities and their terms found in the American academic domain in many cases diverge and also are ambigous in respect to the entities and their naming in the German (also European) academic domain, a greater part of the work within the BUA-project has been to create a mapping of the German domain.

The challenges found in creating an ontology for the German domain on basis of the original VIVO ontology is described in the bachelor thesis: "[Mapping und Erweiterung der Ontologie des Forschungsinformationssystems VIVO](https://doi.org/10.25968/opus-803)", and parallely, some work has already been done by the [VIVO-DE group](https://github.com/VIVO-DE/vivo-de-ontology-extension). 

The group redifined topics like "Faculty", which, in the American domain is the teaching staff, i.e. the entire group of teachers. While a "Fakult√§t" at a German university is an organizational unit for the thematic structure of chairs. A professor in the American domain is a teacher, whereas a German professor is (generally) a holder of a chair.

With this work as a basis, we extended the VIVO ontology with multiple topics through our work in analysing the "Organigrams" (organisational charts) of each member organisation. Structurally the organisational structures would be quite similar, but semantically, the wording, and sometimes the functional meaning of the units would be quite different. To ensure that plurality and local varieties be kept, we needed to take into account that each alliance member would need to use and find research information related to their own terminology. 

To achieve this, we created an upper ontology with common, more abstract classes and an ontology for each member, containing instantiations of common classes retaining local names and idiosyncrasies.

With the ontology classes in place, the next steps is creating the knowledge graph representing alliance scientists, projects  and research ouput, by instantiating classes from the VIVO ontologies.

In Fig. 2, we see that alongside the organizational ontology and the member university ontology extensions, their projects, research results and publications are represented. 
In some cases instantiating classes from the Core VIVO ontology, but also extension classes for Research output types not already existent in the core ontology.

The Organizational structures are partially klassified by the use of subject matters from the German national [DESTATIS](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Methoden/Klassifikationen/Bildung/studenten-pruefungsstatistik.html) Vocabulary in order to create a more ample semantic context for the machine processing of the knowledge graph. In order to provide entites such as projects and project outputs the same overbridging semantic space, a collection of vocabularies describing the research domains are integrated.

*Fig. 3: Horisontal dimension; overbridging Vocabularies*.

Specifically, the [EUDAT B2FIND Disciplinary Research Vocabulary
](https://github.com/BUA-VIVO/eudat-b2find-skos) and the [Kerndatensatz Forschung Interdisciplinary Research Vocabulary]([https://github.com/guescinr/kdsf-ffk_translated](https://github.com/guescinr/kdsf-ffk_translated)).
These are used to classify research output, including Publications of different types as well as Projects in order to collocate them according to their research foci.

The standards CERIF and KDSF standards have still not bin integrated, as they are part of a possible future extension of the project.

Fig. 4 is a diagram showing the subsumption hierarchy of the institutional structures, their classification, as well as the relation between vocabularies and projects and research output.
The vocabularies add an additional layer of semantic space for the ontology and its instances in order to make automatic classification possible. Topics were then extracted from the different vocabularies, defining a semantic space for the vocabulary terms which in themselves are far to generic to be of any use for automatic classification.

The topics form a alliance wide vocabulary of research topics which can be assigned to the the instances, adding yet another viewpoint and level of metadata to optimize the machine computability of search and findability within the alliance knowledge graph.
